# RootWorkSample
How to start this app:
1. npm install
2. Check Version of Node
    I was using Node v12.18.3 when I wrote this program
3. Run this command in the terminal to process the
   sample text file 'input.txt' in the  root directory:
   node index.js < input.txt

   You should see the output in the console. I based this file off of
   the one given in the github readme prompt. If you want to run your own text file 
   an easy way would be to add it to the root directory and use the above command
   with the name of your file as the argument e.g.
   node index.js < yourFile.txt
